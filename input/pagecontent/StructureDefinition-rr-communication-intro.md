The sharing of the Reportability Response with clinical care will serve several functions, including to: 

* Communicate the reportability status, for the responsible PHA(s) of each condition included in the electronic Initial Case Report (eICR)     
* Identify who (a PHA or an intermediary) prepared the Reportability Response     
* Indicate whether the eICR has been sent to one or more PHA(s)     
* Identify which PHA(s) has/have been sent the eICR     
* Provide contact information for the responsible PHA(s)     
* Provide suggested or required clinical follow-up activities from the responsible PHA(s), including any additional reporting needs or infection control activities     
* Provide access to clinical support resources suggested by the responsible PHA(s) for identified reportable conditions     
* Confirm eICR receipt and processing     

A Reportability Response will also, when requested, be shared with the responsible PHAs (when they have not constructed it) for their internal use, so they understand what has been shared with clinical care and, and to monitor/audit decision support algorithm effectivesness and implementation. When a condition is considered reportable to more than one PHA, the Reportability Response can be helpful in communicating reporting that has been done to other PHAs.     

The Reportability Response Communication is also structured to allow:     

* Notification, alerting, routing and queueing in work or message management systems for healthcare personnel     
* Dynamic and static URIs for supplemental data collection and the provision of information resources
