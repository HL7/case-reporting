If the eICR was not processed or was processed with a warning, the reason will be contained in the eICR Processing Status Reason. If there is any output from a validator, that output will be contained in the eICR Validation Output.

If any of the trigger codes used to generate the eICR are from an outdated version of the RCTC or the codes are deprecated by the coding system in the latest version of the RCTC (inactive status), these are flagged and and the eICR Processing Status Reason Detail will hold the details of the outdated and expected versions of the RCTC. Inactive status in the RCTC signifies that a code as been deprecated by the source coding system. Codes with an inactive status will remain in the RCTC and be available for triggering because EHR systems do not update to the most recent version of the coding systems immediately, and thus may continue to trigger on a deprecated code.
