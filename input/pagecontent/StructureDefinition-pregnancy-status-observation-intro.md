This profile includes the determination method, determination date, and recorded date of the pregnancy status.

Use the effectivePeriod to indicate the date range over which the patient was pregnant/possibly pregnant/not pregnant/unknown. To record the date that the pregnancy status was recorded, use the date-recorded-extension and to record the date on which the pregnancy status determination was made, use the date-determined-extension. If the effectivePeriod.end is not present it is assumed that the date range over which the pregnancy status is asserted is from effectivePeriod.start to the date in the date-recorded-extension. For example, if the effectivePeriod.start has been recorded as two months prior to the date contained in the date-recorded-extension, and there is no effectivePeriod.end recorded, no assumptions can be made about the pregnancy status after the date contained in the date-recorded-extension.
