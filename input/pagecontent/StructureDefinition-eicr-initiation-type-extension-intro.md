When code is set to PHC1464, it indicates that the eICR was manually initiated by an action of the provider of care because they suspect there may be a reportable condition. When the code is set to PHC2235, it indicates that the eICR was initiated by automated, forced reporting. Unlike eICRs manually initiated by a provider, PHC2235 will be routed only to the public health agency of the jurisdiction of care unless another reportable condition is found. The eICR could also contain RCTC trigger codes.
