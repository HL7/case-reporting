If there are multiple distinct reasons for manual or alternate initiation then each reason should be contained in a separate eICR Initiation Reason Extension. 

The reason may be entered either as:
* free text (string) 
* coded value (valueCodeableConcept) (not necessarily initiated by a provider of care but might be "programmed-in" by the EHR implementer for some purpose)
