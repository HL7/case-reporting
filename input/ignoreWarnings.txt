# 03 APPROVED by HL7 Cross Group Projects WG: Profiles do not derive from one of the base US profiles because they do not align with any of the US Core Observations (Minutes: https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97453270)
US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Observation derive from one of the base US profiles. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process

# 04 There is no US Core Service request profile in the version of US Core this IG is dependent on (4.0.0)
US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on ServiceRequest derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process

# 08 The html in this text is escaped and is desired behavior
The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at '# '. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour

# 09 From ODH QA for same issue (this template is included from the ODH IG): The slice is defined by value sets from PHINVADS. Since the validator is not able to access those values, it is not able to distinguish the slices even though they are correctly instantiated.

# 10 We are using some versions of a code system that the publisher doesn't have. One of the things we're demonstrating is distribution of value sets with provisional codes. The value sets causing these warnings are a key part of demonstrating that aspect.
