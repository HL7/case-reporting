# APPROVED by HL7 Cross Group Projects WG: Profiles do not derive from one of the base US profiles because they do not align with any of the US Core Observations (Minutes: https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97453270)
US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Observation derive from one of the base US profiles

The string value contains text that looks like embedded HTML tags. If this content is rendered to HTML without appropriate post-processing, it may be a security risk

# From ODH QA for same issue: The slice is defined by value sets from PHINVADS. Since the validator is not able to access those values, it is not able to distinguish the slices even though they are correctly instantiated.

# The Library referenced in the examples does conform to the Profile specified for the slice, but the tooling is not recognizing that it does conform and match the slice.
