# These US Public Health profiles have been further constrained by other profiles in this IG and have not been instantiated in this IG(future plans are to move these PH generic profiles out to a Public Health Library)

# No suitable code in the value set so used another code

# NUCC

# ICD-10-CM codes not currently being validated

# External value sets/code systems

# External value set: this is the Code System specified by PhinVads and exactly copied out of the phinvads FHIR package

# 1. CPT codes can't be checked 2. One of the examples is demonstrating use of the data-absent-reason extension

# APPROVED by HL7 Cross Group Projects WG: Profiles do not derive from one of the base US profiles because they do not align with any of the US Core Observations (https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97453270)

# Examples have optional slices that are not defined in the profile - not matching is expected behaviour

# These examples are ODH examples - ODH was published before the PHINVads/VSAC dependency packages were added and the format for PHINVads links decided

# Validation against profile information messages

# This extension is demonstrated inside the patient example patient-ecr-eve-everywoman

# This extension is demonstrated inside the examples: rr-relevant-reportable-condition-observation and rr-reportability-information-observation

# This extension is demonstrated inside the example: messageheader-ecr-requested-eicr

# This extension is demonstrated inside the example: plandefinition-us-public-health-example

# Newer value set so not in downloaded VSAC package yet

# The html in this is escaped

# From ODH QA for same issue: The slice is defined by value sets from PHINVADS. Since the validator is not able to access those values, it is not able to distinguish the slices even though they are correctly instantiated.

# The Library referenced in the examples does conform to the Profile specified for the slice, but the tooling is not recognizing that it does conform and match the slice.
