# 08 The html in this text is escaped and is desired behavior
The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at '<h'. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour

# 09 From ODH QA for same issue (this template is included from the ODH IG): The slice is defined by value sets from PHINVADS. Since the validator is not able to access those values, it is not able to distinguish the slices even though they are correctly instantiated.

The slice 'CLIA' on path 'Organization.identifier' is not marked as 'must-support' which is not consistent with the element that defines the slicing, where 'must-support' is true
The slice 'NAIC' on path 'Organization.identifier' is not marked as 'must-support' which is not consistent with the element that defines the slicing, where 'must-support' is true
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
