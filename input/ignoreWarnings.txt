# 15: Waiting on approval for variance request: https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-53543
US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Observation derive from one of the base US profiles. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process

# 16: us-ph-patient is based on and further constrains us-core-patient so multiple matches are expected
Found multiple matching profiles for Patient/patient-ecr-eve-everywoman among choices: http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient|6.1.0, http://hl7.org/fhir/us/ph-library/StructureDefinition/us-ph-patient|2.0.0

# 17: Inherited from US Core Organization
The slice 'CLIA' on path 'Organization.identifier' is not marked as 'must-support' which is not consistent with the element that defines the slicing, where 'must-support' is true
The slice 'NAIC' on path 'Organization.identifier' is not marked as 'must-support' which is not consistent with the element that defines the slicing, where 'must-support' is true
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

# 18: This error is coming from the URL checking but is in inherited content. The link is valid, but is to published content in the currently published CRMI spec
