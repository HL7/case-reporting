# No suitable code in the value set so used another code
The Coding provided (http://hl7.org/fhir/us/ecr/CodeSystem/us-ph-usage-context-type#reporting) is not in the value set http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/usage-context-type, and a code should come from this value set unless it has no suitable code (the validator cannot judge what is suitable).  (error message = Not in value set http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/usage-context-type)
# NUCC
[Unable to determine whether the provided codes are in the value set http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-provider-role because the value set or code system is not known to the validator]
# ICD-10-CM codes not currently being validated
The code A01 is not valid in the system http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm
The code A01.0 is not valid in the system http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm
# External value sets/code systems
# External value set: this is the Code System specified by PhinVads and exactly copied out of the phinvads FHIR package
# 1. CPT codes can't be checked 2. One of the examples is demonstrating use of the data-absent-reason extension
# APPROVED by HL7 Cross Group Projects WG: Profiles do not derive from one of the base US profiles because they do not align with any of the US Core Observations (https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97453270)
# APPROVED by Cross Project Workgroup: Profile does not align with US Core Encounter because US Core Encounter does not currently allow PractitionerRole - this is being added for Jan 2021 ballot to US Core and as soon as this functionality is added we will use US Core Encounter (https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97453270)
# These examples are ODH examples - ODH was published before the PHINVads/VSAC dependency packages were added and the format for PHINVads links decided
# Validation against profile information messages
# This extension is demonstrated inside the patient example patient-ecr-eve-everywoman
# Newer value set so not in downloaded VSAC package yet
# The html is escaped
# From ODH QA for same issue: The slice is defined by value sets from PHINVADS. Since the validator is not able to access those values, it is not able to distinguish the slices even though they are correctly instantiated.
