# No suitable code in the value set so used another code
The Coding provided (http://hl7.org/fhir/us/ecr/CodeSystem/us-ph-usage-context-type#reporting) is not in the value set http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/usage-context-type, and a code should come from this value set unless it has no suitable code (the validator cannot judge what is suitable).  (error message = Not in value set http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/usage-context-type)
# NUCC
[Unable to determine whether the provided codes are in the value set http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-provider-role because the value set or code system is not known to the validator]
# ICD-10-CM codes not currently being validated
The code A01 is not valid in the system http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm
The code A01.0 is not valid in the system http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm
# External value sets/code systems
INFORMATION: Bundle/bundle-eicr-document-zika: Bundle.entry[6].resource.ofType(Encounter).type[0].coding[0]: Code System URI 'http://www.ama-assn.org/go/cpt' is unknown so the code cannot be validated
# External value set: this is the Code System specified by PhinVads and exactly copied out of the phinvads FHIR package
# 1. CPT codes can't be checked 2. One of the examples is demonstrating use of the data-absent-reason extension
# APPROVED by HL7 Cross Group Projects WG: Profiles do not derive from one of the base US profiles because they do not align with any of the US Core Observations (https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97453270)
# APPROVED by Cross Project Workgroup: Profile does not align with US Core Encounter because US Core Encounter does not currently allow PractitionerRole - this is being added for Jan 2021 ballot to US Core and as soon as this functionality is added we will use US Core Encounter (https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97453270)
# Validation against profile information messages
# This extension is demonstrated inside the patient example patient-ecr-eve-everywoman
# Newer value set so not in downloaded VSAC package yet
# The html is escaped
INFORMATION: ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.us.ecr: ImplementationGuide.description: The string value contains text that looks like embedded HTML tags. If this content is rendered to HTML without appropriate post-processing, it may be a security risk
# From ODH QA for same issue: The slice is defined by value sets from PHINVADS. Since the validator is not able to access those values, it is not able to distinguish the slices even though they are correctly instantiated.
