This Organization profile represents the Rules Authoring Agency which is the originator of the rules that are being executed in decision support to determine reportability. This may be a state or local PHA. In the majority of cases the Rules Authoring Agency will be the same as the Responsible Agency. Usually, a Local Public Health Agency will inherit rules from its relevant state agency, but a Local agency can adopt, replace or supplement relevant state rules. It is based on the [eCR Organization](StructureDefinition-ecr-organization.html) profile with a further restriction setting the **type** data element to 'Rules Authoring Agency'.
