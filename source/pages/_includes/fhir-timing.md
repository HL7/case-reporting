The importance of having standards developed for when they are needed
exists in a tension with both the long time it takes for broad industry
adoption and the inflated expectations for new technologies. This
tension certainly exists for FHIR standards, but the possibilities for
this promising approach should not undermine what interoperability gains
have been made with the CCD and the C-CDA. While many of the
determinations of standards adoption and roll-out are driven by
incentives, business drivers, and policies from outside of standards
development organizations, your input on some of the related issues can
help guide the trajectory moving forward.

#### Requirements

  - In an interorganizational activity like electronic Case Reporting,
    the coordination of the multiple participants can be very
    challenging. The multiorganizational nature of electronic Case
    Reporting, the heterogenous nature of different clinical care
    organizations and Public Health Agencies, and the number of possible
    intermediaries, makes standards in this domain even more
    complicated.

  - Even before the HITECH funding and Meaningful Use, many Public
    Health Agencies have struggled to match the technology investments
    of clinical care organizations.

  - A common services platform and Health Information Exchanges can, at
    times, play a mapping and translation role in standards advancement,
    but these solutions will not work for everyone.

  - Some standards, like the FHIR Subscription service elsewhere in this
    IG, do not require FHIR servers or adoption on both sides of the
    transaction and may have an easier path to adoption.

  - Consideration should be given to when new standards are ready for
    implementation and have broad industry availability, but also for a
    process for sunsetting old standards and what overlap should exist
    between two approaches.

#### Questions

  - In what timeframe will there be broad enough clinical care adoption
    of FHIR to consider it as a viable option for electronic Case
    Reporting data from EHRs?

  - In what timeframe will some Public Health Agencies begin to use FHIR
    standards. How long will it be until all Public Health Agencies can
    use FHIR?

  - How would you sequence the different parts of the FHIR electronic
    Case Reporting standards suite for advancement and why? (e.g.
    Trigger codes / decision support, the Reportability Response and
    then the eICRâ€¦)

  - When do you think that C-CDA based standards will no longer be the
    primary way to share clinical EHR data?
