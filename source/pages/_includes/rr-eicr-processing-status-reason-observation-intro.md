If the incoming eICR was not successfully processed for a determination of reportability, contains the reason it was not processed.  If any of the trigger codes used to generate the eICR are from an outdated version of the RCTC or the codes are marked as inactive in the latest version of the RCTC, these are flagged and component observations will hold the details of the outdated and expected versions of the RCTC.
