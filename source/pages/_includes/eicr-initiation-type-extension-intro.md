This Extension profile represents that the eICR, was either manually or alternately initiated by the provider. When code is set to PHC1464, it indicates that the eICR was manually initiated by an action of the provider of care because they suspect there may be a reportable condition. When the code is set to PHC2235, it indicates that the eICR was initiated by automated, forced reporting. Unlike eICRs manually initiated by a provider, PHC2235 will be routed only to the public health agency of the jurisdiction of care unless another reportable condition is found. The eICR could also contain RCTC trigger codes.
