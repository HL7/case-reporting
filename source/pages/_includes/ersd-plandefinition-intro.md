This PlanDefinition profile defines the logic and rules around determining: whether or not a condition is reportable to public health, which jurisdiction(s) is/are responsible, which jurisdiction(s) need to be notified, and if the condition is reportable, gives timing information, next steps and condition information to the clinician.
