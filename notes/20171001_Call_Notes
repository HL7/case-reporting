Note that the narrative portions are created more like a Wiki entry than a word document but there are several tools to translate from Word to the proper file format  ( Markdown or xhtml )  One caveat is that the images and tables are best treated as separate files.  The Ig publisher stitches all the pieces together into a single static site and there are other sophisticated programs to create a pdf from the website.
