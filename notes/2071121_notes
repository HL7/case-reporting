I removed the US Realm header and directly reference only the needed stuff.  Also updated the spreadsheet for the Composition (see attached).




Issue of Narrative vs resource Narrative.  - Ask Brett and Rick

The guidance is pretty sketchy:  "The narrative content of the various sections in a Composition are supported by the resources referenced in the section entries"  and say e.g, if the the resource narratives are rendered or the section narrative or both?

Types of Resources _ update the spreadsheet.


11/22/2017:

change name and file name to ECR Composition.  ( remove ccda on fhir )

remove extra stuff - done

fix trigger code representation

level of granularity

   links to datatypes or data elements

move to mappings

move repo to hl7 Repo

publish through docs

Add TOC


pass id parameter to md files since the variable '{{[id]}}' won't work in those cases.

{% capture my-include %}{% include {{[id]}}-intro.md id="{{[id]}}" %}{% endcapture %}{{ my-include | markdownify }}




and whether indicate if profile.
