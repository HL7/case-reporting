20171010 Call Notes

Case not defined by Case Report
Other things define it

#### Need to determine what is a case resource
- Data that are not in EICR or RR maybe specified in case resource.

- case resource that encompasses all the resources like an umbrella
- vs a resource that sits alongside the EICR and RR and contains stuff not called out in other resources

case reporting contains clinical data and metadata about the case.
- eICR
  - meta/context about case
  - other data? (e.g. trigger codes matched,)
  - payload = Clinical data
  - other data not in clinical resources ( e.g. travel history )

- RR
  - Meta/context
  - other data?
  - Payload = Communication Resource?

Triggers/ Decision Logic
  - Meta data about TC/decision
  - TC valueset = payload

- plus extensions

RR - all metadata about the case report transaction.

#### Data from EHR to PH need to be designated
- IG needs to delineate and specify the data elements - payload data from ECR
- IG needs to specify TC as well
- Not part of case

- How to do this
  - list them in narrative fashion
  - constraints in the IG
    - constrain the underlying resources
    - or within contexts of case resource
  - Document resource

Transactions need to be specify

- Case Report
  - PUSH
  - Intermediaries (HIE)
  - etc

  ability to support all, but not specify all of them.
